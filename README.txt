Requires SpaceClaim 2012+ and Visual Studio 2010 or later.

The solution contains several add-ins I've writting to help SpaceClaim customers or for personal art projects.  Code quality is decent, but not as error-safe as production code.  Goals currently are to improve the quality of this code, add more capabilities as needed, and clean-up and move experimental code to the collection.

Projects:
* Unfold: tools for creating flat patterns from planar-faced bodies and generating planar-faced bodies.
* Gear: a gear generator, developed from first principles, not standards.
* Utilities: other miscalaneous tool.
* AddInLibrary: a collection of helper classes that expedite add-in development, including:
	o RibbonCommandCapsule: a toolkit to generate Ribbon.xml UI with parameters quickly. Not in a final state.
	o ShapeHelper: a set of methods to quickly generate geometry
	o And a bunch more
